You can't expect your camera to take great photo, if your imagination is out of focus
The club encourages students to study light and imparts tips on composition.

The club organises activities that give a chance to learn photography, utilise their camera to the fullest and become sensitised to the world around.

The club focuses on interaction between experts and students in addition to enhancing peer learning in photography and build an environment to capture memories forever.
