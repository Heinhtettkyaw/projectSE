    Our club offers regular training sessions with varying levels of intensity depending on what your after; or if you don't want to follow the session your welcome to come along and do your own thing in the free lane as well.

If your looking to compete for the university in BUCS we have two competitions during the year, either side of the christmas break as well as varsity against keele uni towards the end of the year

We are also looking into having regular land based training sessions in the uni gym for that extra bit of fitness
